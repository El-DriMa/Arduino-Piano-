# Arduino-Piano-Project

## Description
This repository contains documentation for the "Arduino Piano" project, which was created in collaboration with a colleague. The project consists of a digital piano made using an Arduino microcontroller. The piano comprises LED lights, switches, and wires, used to play different notes when specific switches are pressed. By pressing a designated switch, a predefined melody can be played.

## Components
- Arduino microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Mega)
- LED lights
- Switches
- Wires
- Speaker (sound sensor)
- 8-bit display
- Resistors
- Battery or external power source

## Images and Videos
This repository includes images and videos documenting the process of building and operating the Arduino piano.

## Notes
The project was a collaborative effort by the team, showcasing the practical application of electronics and programming knowledge.
Images and videos provide a visual representation of the project's operation, given the absence of original code.
## The project was conducted in the year 2021 at High Scool of Electrical Engineering Mostar
